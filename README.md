#### This is a very simple JavaScript test to make you feel comfortable with arrays, strings, objects and JavaScript in general. For now, it has only two levels. Level-1 and Level-2.

## Level - 1.

This level is about basic array manipulation, basic knowledge of objects and strings.

## Level - 2.

This level dives a little deeper into objects, how to work with their properties and cloning them.

<br />

# Instructions.
> To pass each level and all its test cases, you need to write the body of four functions that are already defined in each of the `index.js` files so all tests in the terminal appear green.
Instructions for what each function should do is written above each function inside the `index.js` file for each level.

<br />

To start taking the test:
* `git clone https://github.com/graphicweave/js-test`.
<br />
 
* `cd js-test && npm install` (or `yarn`). 
<br />
 
* `npm start <LEVEL>` (or `yarn start <LEVEL>`). For example, to start completing level-1 enter `npm start level-1` and so on. To complete all tests at once, simply enter `npm start` and all test cases for all levels will be run at once.
<br />

* The test suite is now running in the terminal.
<br />

*  Make changes inside the corresponding `index.js`  file to make all the test cases pass for that level.

<br />

Note - We'll automatically be watching any changes to `index.js` and the test cases will rerun with every save to `index.js` files. Also note that you can use whichever ECMAScript version you like depending upon the version of your node.js.
